## Analysis and Explanation of Solidarity Conceptions in Migration Contexts

### The Joint Project

What conceptions do political decision-makers, as well as social actors, have of solidarity? Can patterns be recognized in communication about migration and flight at the political, social, and individual levels that indicate either solidification or de-solidification? Are solidarity discourses becoming more diverse? How resilient is the solidarity structure, and what communication strategy could reduce de-solidification effects? How do solidarity discourses at the political level correlate with discourses at the individual or social level?

The interdisciplinary research network at the University of Hildesheim addresses these and similar questions. In four sub-projects, researchers from the Institute of Social Sciences in the subjects of Political Science and Sociology and from the Institute of Information Science and Speech Technology cooperate, pursuing a multi-level approach: The micro level (led by Prof. Kneuer) deals with online and offline communication of citizens; the meso level (led by Prof. Corsten) with the communication of socially organized actors and the macro level (led by Prof. Schammann) with the communication of political decision-makers. The discourse-analytical examination at the three levels is implemented using corpus linguistics instruments (led by Prof. Heid).

The research project extends over three years and is funded by the Lower Saxony Ministry of Science and Culture and the Volkswagen Foundation.

### Subproject 3: The Macro Level

The aim of subproject 3 is to determine solidarity conceptions in the context of migration in Germany at the macro level, i.e. within the framework of political negotiation of social solidarity, to distinguish them from one another where appropriate and to trace their development over the past four and a half decades. The subproject analyzes the communication about solidarity by political actors in the narrower sense. This includes in particular speeches in the plenary sessions of the Bundestag and Bundesrat as well as, in a second step, the state parliaments, by members of the Federal Government and the state governments, but also by political parties. Politically active civil society organizations or activists are also examined for individual aspects provided that data from subprojects 1 and 2 cannot be used.

The analysis at the macro level covers the period from November 1973 – the moment of the recruitment stop for foreign workers – to December 2019. Over the investigation period, we are particularly interested in whether and why the prominence of certain definitions varies over the years, i.e. whether specific events are accompanied by specific understandings of solidarity. The investigation period includes various migration phenomena as well as political and legal reactions that have been intensively discussed by the public and politics, including the debates about family reunification (both in the 1970s and 1980s as well as today), the Immigration Act (today's Residence Act) of 2004, the removal of restrictions on the freedom of movement for workers after EU eastern enlargement and the increased refugee migration from third countries (from the mid-1980s, 2015/2016), to name just a few. Whether some of these debates are accompanied by intensified communication about solidarity is investigated using discourse analysis with the help of corpus linguistics instruments.

The subproject is divided into three modules:

1. Investigation of the negotiations on politically established solidarity in the context of migration held between 1973 and 2019 in the plenary sessions of the Bundestag and Bundesrat between members of the Bundestag, members of the Federal Government and the sixteen state governments. The total of approximately 3500 plenary debates held forms the basis of the analysis.

2. In-depth analysis of selected debate strands identified in the first step through an increased concentration of references to solidarity concepts that lead to specific policies (e.g. legislative proposals, but also rather symbolic government action). For this purpose, additional data are collected, such as small and large questions in parliament, plenary debates in state parliaments, party programs or NGO position papers. In this way, not only is a sharper picture of the understanding of solidarity of different speaker groups in the specific context made possible, but also insights into the possibilities of individual actors to gain access to the debates. At the same time, a feedback with the meso and micro levels is carried out. In what form do the identified solidarity discourses conducted at the political level appear again at the social and individual level?

3. Qualitative investigation of the "practical" aspects of political solidarity: The analysis examines the relationship between the policies investigated in the second step and their implementation. Of particular interest here is the comparison of the expressed solidarity conceptions. For this purpose, we conduct qualitative individual interviews with those responsible in the administration at the federal, state, and municipal levels.
